Checklist of Needed Tasks — Most Crucial First:

-Eliminate Look-Ahead Bias in Dynamic Labeling

Implement forward-looking volatility using only pre-pattern data for window calculation.

Run independent audit of temporal integrity (beyond self-reported tests).

-Address Survivorship & Selection Bias

Incorporate delisted, halted, and bankrupt stocks into dataset (if available).

Backtest on survivorship-bias-free universe or use synthetic survivorship adjustment.

-Redesign Validation Strategy

Expand validation period to include multiple market regimes (e.g., 2015–2024).

Ensure at least 500–1000 Target-class samples in validation set.

-Simplify & Justify Hyperparameters

Conduct sensitivity analysis on all thresholds (BBW<30%, ADX<32, volume<35%, etc.).

Document empirical or theoretical rationale for each.

-Revisit Loss Function Design

Remove “coil boost” or rigorously validate coil_intensity as a causal feature.

Test standard focal loss + class weighting vs. current implementation.

-Incorporate Regime Adaptation

Add macroeconomic/market-regime features (VIX, sector rotation, liquidity indicators).

Allow dynamic R-multiple targets and position sizing based on regime.

-Conduct Cross-Region Validation

Test model on US and Asian micro-caps without retraining.

If performance diverges, consider region-specific models or region as a feature.

-Enhance Data Safeguards

Add validations for raw OHLCV (negative volumes, missing splits, outliers).

Implement automated regime-based scenario testing in pipeline.

-Review & Simplify Architecture

Run ablation studies to confirm LSTM+CNN+GRN adds value over simpler model.

Remove unused ablation modes from production code.

-Document All Assumptions & Risks

Publish a model card detailing known biases, failure modes, and market conditions where system underperforms.
